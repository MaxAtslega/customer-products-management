# Customer Products Management
A JavaFX-based application for managing customer and product information. 
This project is a solution for retail operations, designed to streamline the management of products, orders, and customer information. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows retail staff to efficiently add and manage product inventories, track orders, and maintain detailed customer profiles. This project was created during my academic school years as part of my coursework.

## Technical Architecture
### System Architecture
- **Frontend**: JavaFX-based user interface.
- **Backend**: Spring Framework with RESTful API services.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.
- **Security**: Bearer Token Authentication for secure API access.

### Directory Structure
- `/frontend`: Contains the JavaFX project with all frontend-related files.
- `/backend`: Houses the Spring Framework project for backend services.
- `/scripts`: Scripts for environment setup, deployment, and other utilities.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): JDK version 19 or later is required. You can download it from Oracle's website or through a package manager like apt on Ubuntu or Homebrew on macOS.
2. The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains `./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.
3. Docker: Docker is used to run the application in a container. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Project Setup
Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MaxAtslega/customer-products-management.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
  cd customer-products-management
```

### Backend Setup
Instructions for installing and running the Spring Boot backend.

#### Prerequisites
Navigate into the backend directory:

```bash
  cd backend
```

#### Building the application
To build the backend execute the following command:

```shell
  ./gradlew build
```
#### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```shell
  ./gradlew assemble
```

Create docker image:

```shell
  docker-compose build
```


### Frontend Installation
Instructions for installing and running the JavaFX frontend, detailing system prerequisites and configuration steps.

#### Prerequisites
Navigate into the backend directory:

```bash
  cd frontend
```

#### Building the application
To build the frontend execute the following command:

```shell
  ./gradlew build
```

#### Run the JavaFX Application
After a successful build, start the JavaFX application using Gradle:
    
```shell
   ./gradlew run
```

### Troubleshooting
- JDK Compatibility Issues: Check your JDK version with java -version. The project requires JDK 19 or later.
- Gradle Build Failures: If the build fails, inspect the console for error messages. Common issues include network connectivity problems or missing dependencies.
- JavaFX Runtime Components Missing: Ensure that your PATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables are correctly set, pointing to your JDK installation.
